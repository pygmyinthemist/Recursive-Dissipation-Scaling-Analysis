# Recursive-Dissipation-Scaling-Analysis
Computational framework for analysing thermodynamic scaling in recursive causal topologies ($DRTB$). Investigating non-monotonic shifts in the scaling exponent $\alpha$ within driven dissipative systems and their alignment with dissipative adaptation principles.
