# Recursive-Dissipation-Scaling-Analysis

This computational analysis instantiates a core mechanistic principle from the NR+AC ontological framework to study its dynamical consequences:

**Framework:** "Asymmetric Causation and Neutral Relata: A Dual-Primitive Ontology for Physics and Consciousness"  
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.18402408](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18402408)

**Principle Implemented:** The framework posits Asymmetric Causation (A) as a fundamental directional constraint on state space trajectories (derived from thermodynamic reversibility costs). This simulation embodies this principle by implementing **catalytic feedback loops** in a CRN, where the feedback strength parameter `β` directly models the intensity of the A-constraint, allowing investigation of its effect on network efficiency and stability.
